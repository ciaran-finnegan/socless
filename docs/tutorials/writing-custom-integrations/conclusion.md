# Conclusion

Congratulations on completing this tutorial! :fireworks: :fireworks:

In doing so we learned how to:

* Code our own Custom Integrations in Python using `socless_bootstrap` from the [socless_python](https://github.com/twilio-labs/socless_python) library
* Configure our Integrations for deployment in our `serverless.yml`
* Reference them in our Playbooks using [Serverless Variables](../../reference/variables.md#serverless-variables)


Wow. If Bruce Wayne was here, he'd be super impressed by our fancy new toys. Waaaait a minute. We almost forgot about Bruce! Shouldn't we find out what he's been up to in China?

Maybe our [Human Interactions Tutorial](../human-interaction/interacting-via-slack.md) can help us with that :wink:
