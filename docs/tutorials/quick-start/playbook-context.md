# Playbook Execution Context Overview

When a Playbook executes, it stores the event that triggered it and the data generated by each State in an object called the `Playbook Execution Context`.

The Playbook Execution Context isn't something we create manually -- SOCless automatically takes care of creating and managing it. However, understanding its structure is key to writing Playbooks, because the Playbook Execution Context is how States pass information to each other.

Conceptually, the Playbook Execution Context has the following structure

```json
{
  "artifacts": {
    "event": {
      "details": {
        ... # Event the Playbook was triggered with
      }
    }
  },
  "results": {
    ... # Results from Successful Playbook States appear here
  },
  "errors": {
    ... # Errors from Failed Playbook States appear here
  }

}
```

- `artifacts.event.details`: Contains the event that triggered the playbook (this doesn't change through the life of the Execution)
- `results`: This stores the data generated by each State after it executes. It grows in size over the course of a Playbook's execution
- `errors`: Any errors generated by failed States show up here

While there are other fields that may exist in the object, we'll focus on these for now.

As an example, imagine we had a playbook that's triggered by the event below
```json
--8<-- "docs-snippets/quick-start/playbook_details.json"
```

The tab below shows what the `Playbook Execution Context` might look like when the playbook first starts (before any states have executed), and after our `Geolocate_IP` state has completed


=== "Playbook Execution Context at Start"
    ```json hl_lines="4-7"
    --8<-- "docs-snippets/quick-start/playbook_initial_context.json"
    ```


=== "After Geolocate_IP state"
    ```json hl_lines="10-20"
    --8<-- "docs-snippets/quick-start/playbook_after_geolocate.json"
    ```

Any State in our Playbook that executes after `Geolocate_IP` would then be able to access the results generated by `Geolocate_IP` by the `results.Geolocate_IP` section of the `Playbook Execution Context`.


!!! note
    The `results` and `errors` keys won't actually exist when the playbook execution context is first created but will appear over time as the playbook executes

Let's start developing our Playbook so that we can see this all in action.
