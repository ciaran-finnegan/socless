# Introduction
The SOCless Betterments List is a list of improvements the Socless automation framework needs to become the premier security automation framework.

# How to use the list
Each item on this list is an opportunity to own a significant component of Socless and guide it to success. Read through each item of the list and take ownership of a betterment you're excited to tackle.

As you work on a betterment, ensure that is is always updated with one and only one of the below statuses:

UNCLAIMED: The betterment is not actively owned by an individual

SPIKING: An individual/team has claimed ownership of the project and is actively working on solution proposal

IN PROGRESS: A proposed solution has been accepted and is being implemented

DEPLOYED: The solution has been deployed to the Socless production environment

ABANDONED: The betterment has been abandoned and will no longer be applied to the platform


Important note: Owning a betterment does not mean you have to work on it alone. It is highly recommended that you collaborate with a team throughout the lifecycle of the process. However, there can be only one owner for a betterment. That owner is designated as the lead.
